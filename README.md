   - Trained models: Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost.
   - Selected the best model and saved as `gwp.pkl`.
3. **Flask App Development**
   - Created HTML templates: `home.html`, `about.html`, `predict.html`, `submit.html`.
   - Integrated the ML model with Flask for real-time predictions.
4. **Deployment Ready**
